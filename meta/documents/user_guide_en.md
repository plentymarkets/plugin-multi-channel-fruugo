We connected plentymarkets with the marketplace Fruugo to give you yet another opportunity to place your items internationally and to expand your customer base.

Fruugo is a global market which is specialized in cross-boarder trade. With Fruugo you can reach potential customers in 23 countries - among them numerous EU countries as well as Russia, Australia, the USA and South Africa. The platform removes potential obstacles that may hinder an easy start in global trade.

## Goodbye language barriers

If you want to sell internationally you need to speak the buyer's language. This is a presumed platitude that seems to be the most difficult obstacle that has to be overcome by sellers who want to gain foothold on the international market. Many try to avoid the efforts and costs for a multilingual online presence, multilingual item descriptions and for providing a customer service in different languages. With Fruugo, you simply transfer your item descriptions to the marketplace in the language that they are already saved in. The descriptions will then automatically be translated into the languages of those countries in which you offer your items via Fruugo. Currently there are 11 languages available.

## Currency, payment methods and VAT

Fruugo also makes payment easy for you. You can list your items in your online store's standard currency. The customers, however, will see product prices in their own country's currency. The currencies are converted automatically. Fruugo also has integrated important payment methods and you do not need to worry about the various value added taxes in international selling.

## Protection against attempted fraud

Fruugo checks all incoming orders to prevent fraud. In the case that a fraud attempt can not be uncovered you will still receive the payment for the order. Fruugo bears liability.

## No fixed charges

Fruugo does not charge any costs for registration or basic fees. Regardless of the types of items that you list on Fruugo - only a percentage of the item's net price, currently 10 %, will be charged.
